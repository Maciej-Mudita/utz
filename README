# Micro Time Zone Library

A ~3kB timezone library featuring nearly all current timezones present in
the IANA timezone database. Designed for use on budget embedded systems
with very low program space.

## Tradeoffs

A limited number of aliases are available. (by default restricted to the
same set that android uses) In cases where the alias is not available,
the standard time UTC offset and abbreviation (if present) will be
displayed.
